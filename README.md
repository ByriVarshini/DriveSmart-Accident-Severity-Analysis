# **DriveSmart: Data-Powered Decision Support for Accident Severity Analysis**

### 📊 *A Machine Learning-Based System to Predict Road Accident Severity and Support Data-Driven Decision Making*

---

## 🧠 **Overview**

**DriveSmart** is a data-driven decision-support system designed to enhance **road safety** by predicting the **severity of traffic accidents** before they occur.
Using machine learning algorithms and real-world datasets, the system analyzes factors like **weather**, **road conditions**, **vehicle type**, and **driver details** to classify accidents as *Fatal*, *Serious*, or *Slight*.

The goal is to empower **traffic authorities, emergency responders, and policymakers** with predictive insights to take **proactive actions**, optimize **emergency response**, and design **safer road infrastructure**.

---

## 🎯 **Key Objectives**

* Develop a **machine learning model** to predict accident severity.
* Identify **critical factors** influencing accident outcomes.
* Provide **data visualizations** and **severity analytics dashboards**.
* Assist stakeholders in **decision-making** and **resource planning**.
* Promote **safer, smarter, and more sustainable** transportation systems.

---

## 🧩 **Problem Statement**

Traffic accidents cause millions of deaths and injuries globally each year. Traditional analysis methods are slow and reactive, making it difficult to predict accident outcomes effectively.

This project addresses the problem by using **machine learning** to deliver a **proactive, data-driven solution** that:

* Predicts the severity level of an accident.
* Highlights accident-prone locations.
* Assists authorities in quick decision-making and preventive planning.

## 🧮 **Machine Learning Workflow**

1. **Data Collection:**
   Accident datasets obtained from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in) and [UK Stats19](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data).

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   Extracting and ranking key parameters like weather, road surface, and vehicle type.

4. **Model Training:**
   Algorithms tested – Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression.

   * **Best model:** Random Forest Classifier
   * **Accuracy achieved:** 86.86%

5. **Prediction:**
   Classifies accidents into *Fatal*, *Serious*, or *Slight* categories.

6. **Visualization:**

   * Displays severity trends and heatmaps.
   * Interactive charts for accident frequency and severity by location.
